# Tutorial how to install
Download the plugin and its dependencies and put the DLLs in the EXILED plugins folder. Once you have placed all the files, start the server. A folder called 'audio' will be created; put the OGG file inside that folder. Remember to download the dependencies and MapEditorReborn to be able to load the plugin. Have fun!
# Create your own table
To create your own table in Unity with MapEditorReborn, you need to create a button called 'Button106'.
# Configuration file
If you want to change the language, you can do it in the configuration file. If you also want to change the accuracy percentage, it's there as well. Additionally, if you want to disable the audio bot, that's also there.
# Spawn the schematic automatically
To make the table schematic spawn automatically, you need to spawn the table with "mp cr 106recontainment" and then move it with "mp pos grab". To save it, use "mp save Femurbreaker". Then, go to the settings of "MapEditorReborn" and where it says "Load_map_on_event:", where it says "on_round_started: []", put it in "on_round_started:" as shown in the picture below.
